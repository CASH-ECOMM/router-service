# Local development profile - use when running router-service locally against Docker services
# Run with => ./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=local
# Or in run config in IntelliJ add following to env variables => SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=local

# Connect to all gRPC services running in Docker (exposed to localhost)
grpc.client.user-service.address=static://localhost:50051
grpc.client.catalogue-service.address=static://localhost:50052
grpc.client.payment-service.address=static://localhost:50053
grpc.client.auction-service.address=static://localhost:50054

# Override individual services via env vars if running locally:
# Example: export USER_SERVICE_ADDRESS=static://localhost:9090
# This allows mixing local and Docker services flexibly
